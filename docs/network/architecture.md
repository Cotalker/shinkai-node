## Architecture

The Node-based architecture you have implemented is a good starting point for a peer-to-peer (P2P) network. However, depending on the specific requirements of your application, there are many ways to enhance or change this implementation. Some of them include:

1. **Connection Management**: The current implementation does not actively manage connections. You can introduce a connection manager to keep track of all the connected nodes, check the health of the connections, and drop connections that are inactive or not responding. 

2. **Message Routing**: Implementing some sort of routing protocol to propagate messages in the network could be beneficial. This is especially important in larger P2P networks where not all nodes are directly connected to each other.

3. **Concurrency Management**: Your current implementation uses async tasks for handling incoming and outgoing connections. It would be better to have more structured task management to limit the number of concurrent tasks, and to properly clean up tasks that are finished or errored.

4. **Peer Discovery**: Another feature that could be added is a peer discovery mechanism. Currently, you have to manually specify which node to connect to. With peer discovery, nodes can automatically find each other.

5. **Reliability**: Implement a retry mechanism for failed message sends. In a P2P network, peers can join and leave the network unpredictably, so message delivery is not always guaranteed. You might want to implement a retry mechanism or even a more advanced reliable transport protocol on top of TCP.

6. **Security**: You could add more security features, such as encrypting the entire communication, not just the messages, authenticating nodes, or protecting against denial-of-service attacks.

7. **Scalability**: As your network grows, you might need to implement some form of distributed hash table (DHT) for more efficient message routing.

8. **Error Handling**: Improve error handling. In a real-world application, you should avoid using `.unwrap()` and instead handle errors gracefully.

9. **Testing**: Implement tests to ensure the correct behavior of your application. This could include unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests.

These are just some examples of how you could improve your P2P network. The specific improvements and features you should implement depend heavily on the requirements of your application. A P2P network for file sharing, for example, would have very different requirements compared to a P2P network for a multiplayer game.
